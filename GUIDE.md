Snowdrift.coop
==============

This guide covers the [Snowdrift.coop](https://snowdrift.coop) codebase and development process.

Step-by-step instructions require no more than beginning-level programming or web designer experience.

This guide assumes you are running a GNU/Linux system and have at least a *basic* understanding of command-line operations.
If you are on a different system or need *any* other help, come say "hi" at our freenode.net IRC channel [#snowdrift](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/irc).
We are always happy to assist and answer *any* questions!


About the frameworks and tools we use
=====================================

Snowdrift.coop uses the **[Yesod web framework](http://www.yesodweb.com/)**.
Like the software itself, the associated book and documentation are all Free/Libre/Open (FLO) and quite thorough.

Yesod uses the Haskell programming language alongside its
[Shakespearean Templates](http://www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates).
With some minor variations (such as indentation instead of closing tags or bracketing),
these templates use standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Our front-end uses **[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** for layout and styles,
although we use our own custom CSS in many cases.

A suggestion for beginners: Firefox's built-in developer tools
and the [Firebug](https://getfirebug.com) plugin both offer great (and complementary) functions
for testing and experimenting with the live site.


Learning Haskell
----------------

Because everything is integrated, some familiarity with Haskell syntax is helpful
even if you stay mostly with front-end development.
At any rate, Haskell is a powerful and enjoyable language worth learning
for anyone interested in programming.

To learn Haskell, we recommend these FLO resources:

* The [Haskell Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell) offers a superb introductory overview and includes links to many additional resources.
* At Stack Overflow, see the tags for [yesod](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yesod) and [haskell](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yesod)
* Alongside #snowdrift on freenode.net, check out the channels #yesod #haskell and #haskell-beginners
* A useful development tool  is "cabal repl" â€” a command that loads [ghci](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Using_GHCi_effectively) in a mode connected to the project. Using that, you can easily import files from the code and explore the functions.
* To help write clean Haskell code and learn conventions, run hlint on your files to get suggestions for possible improvements.
    * Given a working Haskell installation, add hlint with the command "cabal install hlint"


Text-editor settings
--------------------

We recommend setting your text editor to have the TAB key do indentation of four spaces.

### vim

For vim users, your config file .vimrc should include these three lines:

    set expandtab
    set shiftwidth=4
    set tabstop=4

You should also install
[Shakespearean Syntax Highlighting for vim](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-syntax-shakespeare)

Some other optional vim plugins to consider (among many available):
[Haskell-Vim extra syntax](https://github.com/raichoo/haskell-vim) and
[vim2hs](https://github.com/dag/vim2hs)


### Emacs

Emacs users should use a package manager (preferably Marmalade) to install
[Haskell Mode](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode) and [Hamlet Mode](https://github.com/lightquake/hamlet-mode).
Our included [`.dir-locals.el`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html) file
makes Emacs use the recommended indentation.


Development guidelines and notes
================================

Overall, we strive to follow universal standards, be fully accessible, and avoid browser-specific code.

We generally build with *progressive enhancement* in mind.
Content and functions should work with simple HTML/CSS along with Yesod/Haskell server-side functions.
Later, we add JavaScript as appropriate for enhancement.
Consider the ideas of [Unobtrusive JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript).
Use of NoScript should never causes a broken experience.
We also make sure all our JavaScript is recognized
by the FSF's [LibreJS plugin](https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/).

We have separate wiki and discussion pages on the site
for [web-design issues](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/site-design)
and [coding issues](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/w/coding).
We also have a complete [list of tickets](https://snowdrift.coop/p/snowdrift/t) in all categories.

Please consider adding concise comments to your code explaining to others anything you think may be unclear.
Ideally, follow the syntax for
[Haddock Haskell documentation](http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/markup.html).


Working on the code
===================

See the main [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) if you are new to Git.
You only need rudimentary understanding of Git to start contributing to our code.
It will help to understand basic branching so that you can segregate work on different features.

Cloning the repository
----------------------

1. Have or make an account on Gitorious or GitHub
2. Clone (Gitorious' term) or Fork (GitHub's term) the snowdrift repository to your account
3. Tell Gitorious/GitHub the public side of your local SSH key
    * If you don't yet have a key, create one on your local machine with the command "ssh-keygen"
    * The public part is in the .pub file (such as id_rsa.pub)
    * Both sites have further instructions if this isn't clear enough
4. On your local machine, use the `git clone` command with the Gitorious or Github address for your account

This will create a directory and download the code to it.
In the future, when in the new directory,
`git pull` will update your local machine from your Gitorious or GitHub account,
and `git push` will go the other direction, sending any local commits to Gitorious or GitHub.

After pushing to your online account,
alert us to the changes with Gitorious' "request merge" or GitHub's "pull request" commands on their websites.

To get updates from our main code, use

    git fetch git@gitorious.org:snowdrift/snowdrift.git

Then, to see the diff for the updates, use

    git diff FETCH_HEAD

To edit the new code before merging, you can do

    git checkout FETCH_HEAD

To merge the update, make sure you checkout the branch where you want the updates, then

    git merge FETCH_HEAD

Note: when collaborating with others across Gitorious and GitHub (or other hosts),
you can use the same fetch process by using the git address from each developer
and simply communicate by e-mail or IRC or other options about when to fetch updates.


Building
--------

### Notes for different operating systems:

We don't yet have all the details documented, but Snowdrift has been successfully built
on Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Gentoo, and related distros of GNU/Linux and should work on all
other distros.

For NixOS, see the notes in the appendix here under the section about Nix package manager.

Snowdrift also has been built on Mac OS Yosemite.
The Mac OS build process seems to have some issues with postgres user names being different;
so until we address that, the database set-up for Mac OS will need to be done manually,
and the precise commands may vary slightly from the ones we include here.


### Build steps

Install the essential dependencies: ghc, cabal, postgresql, happy, alex, zlib1g

Some additional dependencies (which may vary for different systems) include: libpq-dev, libglib2.0-dev, libcairo2-dev, libpango1.0-dev

TODO: determine whether all the dependencies, even the libs, are still required with our new Yesod 1.4 update.

On Debian-based GNU/Linux distros, use this command:

    sudo apt-get install ghc cabal-install postgresql zlib1g-dev libpq-dev happy alex libglib2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev

**Note: we are now using GHC 7.8.x**
If your system's GHC version is older, get the update from <https://www.haskell.org/ghc/>

Next, update cabal's package list:

    cabal update

Add ~/.cabal/bin locations to your PATH;
for bash, edit your ~/.bashrc (or equivalent) file and add the following line:

    export PATH=.cabal-sandbox/bin:~/.cabal/bin:$PATH

(you'll need to start a new terminal or run "source ~/.bashrc" to make the PATH active)

Now, upgrade cabal itself:

    cabal install cabal-install

Then, run

    cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools

TODO: test if that gtk2hs thing is still needed to be separately installed given updated Yesod 1.4 dependencies.

**change to your snowdrift project directory (if not already there).**

Then, initiate a cabal sandbox:

    cabal sandbox init

Install dependencies and build Snowdrift

    cabal install --enable-tests -fdev

This will take a *long* time but should ultimately tell you it installed Snowdrift.
Note: the `-fdev` flag skips optimization to make build faster. It should be ommited for building the actual live site.

Contact us for help if the build is not successful.


Setting up the database
-----------------------

We offer a simple script that will setup the PostgreSQL databases for you.
Some systems may need some extra set-up, but for most GNU/Linux systems, simply run:

    sdm init

It will prompt you for your sudo password.

If you prefer to set up databases manually, see the appendix at the end of this guide.


Running the site
----------------

After completing all the steps above,
you can start the server from within your snowdrift directory with the command:

    Snowdrift Development

To stop the running server, press ctrl-C

To rebuild after code changes, run `cabal install` (perhaps with `-fdev` to skip optimization).

(note `cabal build` works as well but fails to recognize changes to template files)


After the server starts, it may print a bunch of text about creating tables,
and it will then sit ready, waiting for connections.
When you need to update an executable, use cabal install.


Using the live test site
------------------------

Test the running site by directing your web browser to localhost:3000

You can log into the site via the built-in system with user: admin pass: admin

You can now register new users, make pledges, add discussion comments, tickets, wiki pages, blog posts, and test and work on all aspects of the site.


Running tests
=============

After making various changes to the code and running locally
to verify that everything compiles and also appears to work as desired,
best practice involves then running our automated tests before sharing your changes with the main project.

Assuming you ran `sdm init` when you first set up the databases, run the tests with:

    yesod test

If tests fail, try to figure out what is wrong. Ask us for help if needed.


Additional notes about databases
================================

Database migrations
-------------------

After any change to the database schema (in config/models),
the first time you recompile and then start the server,
a migration script will be automatically generated and placed in /migrations.

The safe (i.e. guaranteed not to lose data) statements, if any,
are placed in migration/migrateN where N is the next number in sequence.

If there are no unsafe statements in the migration,
the safe statements will be run and the server will continue to start normally.

If there are any unsafe (may destroy data) statements,
they are placed in migrations/migrate.unsafe, and the server will abort.

In an unsafe case, if the data *is* intended to be lost
(e.g. destroying a column storing data we no longer want),
just copy the statements to the new migrateN file (creating it if necessary).

If you don't want to lose the data
(a column is being moved to a different table, a column is being renamed, &c),
modify the migration file to use the appropriate intended SQL commands.


Committing database migrations
------------------------------

In the course of testing and/or resetting your database, you might generate extra migrations.
When that happens, be sure to reset your database and remove any extraneous migration files.
Once you have a final version of the code, you can run the site once to generate the correct final migration.

Ideally consolidate all migrations so there is only one migration file per commit.

Make sure to add the associated migration file to git when you commit the corresponding schema changes.

When merging migrations, always put any you've added on the end in separate file(s).
Don't merge them into migration files others may have already run.


Resetting or updating your development database
-----------------------------------------------

To remove any changes and reset your database to the devDB default
(such as when others have provided a new update you want to try
or to start clean before making changes you plan to commit) run:

    sdm reset --db=dev


Sharing updates to the devDB database
-------------------------------------

If you make specific improvements or additions to your database
that aren't just playing around but that you think will make for a better starting database
for other contributors (and also when you have updated the basic database with migration files),
you can use the following command to export the changes (which can then be committed via git as usual).

While in your project directory:

    sdm export --db=dev

which is the same as running:

    sudo -u postgres pg_dump snowdrift_development >devDB.sql


Updating to the latest test database
------------------------------------

When the testDB.sql file is updated, you'll need to update your template.

Although `sdm reset --db=test` ought to work, something is wrong with that script as of this writing.

If you run `sdm clean` followed by `sdm init`,
that will work, but it will reset both your development *and* test databases.

If you don't want to reset your development database,
you can *manually* reset only the test database.
See the appendix section at the end of this guide.

Happy hacking!

APPENDIX A: Using yesod devel
=============================

A useful development tool, `yesod devel` will rebuild snowdrift, start the server,
*and* can stay running and will automatically update the build after each saved change
(although it fails to auto-recognize changes in some file types like .cassius).

To enable yesod devel, you must first install yesod-bin.
Unforunately, yesod-bin will not currently build in the same sandbox with the main site.

So, at this time, to enable yesod devel, first make a new directory for yesod-bin.
Call it "yesod-bin-sandbox" perhaps.

Then, inside the new directory, run `cabal sandbox init` followed by `cabal install yesod-bin`.

Next, add to the new directory to your PATH. Put in your .bashrc the line:

    export PATH=~/yesod-bin-sandbox/.cabal-sandbox/bin:$PATH

(change the ~/ to wherever you actually put the directory)

In a new terminal (so it recognizes the new path),
you can rebuild and start the server in your snowdrift directory by running

     yesod devel

To stop yesod devel, press ENTER a couple times

Note that `yesod devel` builds just the library,
so `cabal install` and related commands are needed to update other resources like sdm or the payment processing script.


APPENDIX B: Using the Nix package manager
=========================================

We're now testing the use of Nix as a reliable, simple way to manage packages for Snowdrift.
Once we have it fully working, it should help simplify building overall.
**The instructions in this appendix are just draft and need cleaning up.**
We're not sure each of these commands is best, it may change as we continue testing.

* To install Nix, visit [NixOS.org/nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and follow the Get Nix instructions (works for GNU/Linux and Mac OS).

* Note: Nix can take a *lot* of drive space, so if you do not have many GB of free space on your root partition, you may need to find another approach, free up space, or put the nix directory somewhere else with more space and edit /etc/fstab to bind the location to mount at /nix 

Next, log out and back into your whole system (The environment variables command shown at the end of the install script's output works for the immediate terminal session for a temporary fix)

Within the snowdrift project directory,

Run `nix-shell --pure -j4 shell.nix` to get necessary libraries and set path

(the -j4 part should be adapted to fit the number of cores on your machine)

The first time this is run, it will take a long time, but then will present you a new prompt within nix-shell.

Within the nix shell, run `cabal configure -fdev --enable-tests && cabal build -j4`

(Note the -fdev argument speeds up the build by bypassing optimization, which means the site runs slower, but that's not a problem for development work)

This will take a *long* time but should ultimately tell you it installed Snowdrift.

TODO: someone should figure out still if the path stuff for .bashrc is the same as the plain cabal process or something else.
If the path is not set right, you will need a longer command with /dist/â€¦ in order to run Snowdrift Development and sdm

Note: all this may work as is, but there may be value in installing the [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) and setting the path to use that when running nix-shell.


Note for users of NixOS
-----------------------

To get the sdm script to work, NixOS users should install postgres by adding these lines to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

  services.postgresql.enable = true;
  services.postgresql.package = pkgs.postgresql94;

Then issue `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to install.
Afterwards you may need to create the postgres user, like so:

    sudo -su root
    createuser -s -r postgres


APPENDIX C: Manual database management
======================================

Our sdm script makes database management quick and easy.
All the steps below can be done simply with the sdm script,
but here we explain what it does and how to handle databases manually if you prefer.
The commands below are written with GNU/Linux in mind.

Notes for Mac OS X
------------------

Assuming the postgres server is running, where `sudo -u postgres psql` is seen below, run `psql postgres` instead.
The commands that don't use psql can be adapted to run within the psql command line.


Setting up the development database manually
--------------------------------------------

Go to the config/ directory within the project directory,
make a copy of postgresql.template, and name the new file postgresql.yml

Create database user called "snowdrift_development" *without* superuser, createdb, or createuser priveleges:

    sudo -u postgres createuser -S -D -R snowdrift_development

Create snowdrift_development database:

    sudo -u postgres createdb snowdrift_development

Run postgres psql:

    sudo -u postgres psql

You should see a line that looks like:

    postgres=#

Add a password to the snowdrift_development user
(for reference, the sdm script generates a random passphrase for this step;
you may substitute any arbitrary passphrase instead of 'somepassphrase'):

    postgres=# alter user snowdrift_development with encrypted password 'somepassphrase';

Then add user to database:

    postgres=# grant all privileges on database snowdrift_development to snowdrift_development;

Leave postgres (with ctrl-D).

Edit config/postgresql.yml and update the password to match the one you entered.

Import development database:

    sudo -u postgres psql snowdrift_development <devDB.sql


Reset the development database manually
---------------------------------------

Start by deleting your database:

    sudo -u postgres psql <<<'drop database snowdrift_development'

Then simply re-create the database by rerunning two of the commands
from the "Setting up" section above.

First the "Create snowdrift database" command:

    sudo -u postgres createdb snowdrift_development

and then the "Import development database" command:

    sudo -u postgres psql snowdrift_development <devDB.sql

That's it. You will *not* need to re-run the database user commands.


Setting up the test template database manually
----------------------------------------------

Like setting up the original development database,
we need to set up a database and user for testing.

Create database user *without* superuser or createrole priveleges but *with* createdb priveleges:

    sudo -u postgres createuser -S -d -R snowdrift_test

Create the snowdrift_test database *template*:

    sudo -u postgres createdb snowdrift_test_template

Run postgres psql to bring up the postgres=# prompt:

    sudo -u postgres psql

At the postgres=# prompt, mark the new database as a template:

    postgres=# update pg_database set datistemplate=true where datname='snowdrift_test_template';

Then, add any arbitrary passphrase to the snowdrift_test user
(substitute whatever you like instead of somepassphrase):

    postgres=# alter user snowdrift_test with encrypted password 'somepassphrase';

Leave postgres (with ctrl-D).

If you used a different password than the one you used for snowdrift_development,
then edit config/postgresql.yml
and add a "password:" line under "Testing:" along with your new passphrase.

Finally, import the testDB.sql to the new template database:

    sudo -u postgres psql snowdrift_test_template <testDB.sql


Resetting the testDB manually
-----------------------------

Go to the postgres=# prompt:

    sudo -u postgres psql

Unmark the template (don't include the postgres=# prompt part):

    postgres=# update pg_database set datistemplate=false where datname='snowdrift_test_template';

Use ctrl-D to leave the prompt.

Drop the template DB:

    sudo -u postgres psql <<<'drop database snowdrift_test_template'

Then we repeat the commands above for setting up the test DB,
skipping the dependencies/user-creation/password parts (those don't need updating).

    sudo -u postgres createdb snowdrift_test_template
    sudo -u postgres psql
    postgres=# update pg_database set datistemplate=true where datname='snowdrift_test_template';
    sudo -u postgres psql snowdrift_test_template <testDB.sql
